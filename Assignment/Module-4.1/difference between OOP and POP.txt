
* Question:-What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

	Answer:-


	* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

	
      - OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and            does not allow it to flow freely around the system.

      - In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).

      - It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and               protects it from accidental modification from outside function.

      - OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called          objects and then builds data and function around these objects.

      - The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated           with that object. However, function of one object can access the                function of other objects.

      - C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of Object oriented               programming (OOP) language.





	* Procedural Oriented Programming (POP):


      - In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into             smaller programs known as functions.

      - In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.

      - In POP, each procedure (function) contains a series of instructions             for performing a specific task.

      - During the program execution each procedure (function) can be called            by the other procedures.

      - To call a procedure (function), we have to write function name only.

      - While we concentrate onto the development of functions, we give very            little attention to the data that are being used by various functions.

      - In POP, the major emphasis is on procedure (function) and not on the            data. 

      - In a multi-function program, many important data items are placed as            global so that they may be accessed by all the functions. Each function         may have its own local data.

      - Global data are more vulnerable to an accidental change by a function.          In a large program it is very difficult to identify what data is used           by which function.

      - Examples of procedural oriented programming language are COBOL,                 FORTRAN, PASCAL, C programming language etc.



		* Difference Between OOP and POP *


          OOP:-


  1.  Definition:  OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.

  2.  Approach:    OOP follows bottom up approach.

  3.  Division:    A program is divided to objects and their interactions.

  4.  Inheritance  inheritance is supported.
      supported:

  5.  Access       Access control is supported via access modifiers.
      control:
       
  6.  Data Hiding: Encapsulation is used to hide data.

  7.  Example:     C++, Java



       POP:-


  1.  Definition:  POP stands for Procedural Oriented Programming.

  2.  Approach:    POP follows top down approach.

  3.  Division:    A program is divided into functions and they interacts.

  4.  Inheritance  inheritance is not supported.
      supported:

  5.  Access       No access modifiers are supported.
      control:

  6.  Data Hiding: No data hiding present. Data is globally accessible.

  7.  Example:     C, Pascal
