       ANSWER ->

       * Trigger: 

          A trigger is a stored procedure in database which       automatically invokes whenever a special event in the         database occurs. For example, a trigger can be invoked        when a row is inserted into a specified table or when         certain table columns are being updated. 

          A trigger is a special type of stored procedure         that automatically runs when an event occurs in the           database server. DML triggers run when a user tries to        modify data through a data manipulation language (DML)        event.DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE           statements on a table or view.

     * CREATE TRIGGER:

         Creates a DML, DDL, or logon trigger. A trigger is a      special type of stored procedure that automatically runs      when an event occurs in the database server. DML           triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a       data manipulation language (DML) event.
 
         DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements       on a table or view. These triggers fire when any valid        event fires, whether table rows are affected or not. For      more information,see DML Triggers.

         DDL triggers run in response to a variety of data         definition language (DDL) events. These events primarily      correspond to Transact-SQL CREATE, ALTER, and DROP          statements, and certain system stored procedures that         perform DDL-like operations.

        Logon triggers fire in response to the LOGON event         that's raised when a user's session is being      established.

       You can create triggers directly from Transact-SQL          statements or from methods of assemblies that are      created in the Microsoft .NET Framework common language      runtime (CLR) and uploaded to an instance of SQL Server.      SQL Server lets you create multiple triggers for any      specific statement.
