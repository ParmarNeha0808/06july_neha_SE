 Q-2:What is Normalization? 

   Answer:-

      Normalization is a database design technique that             reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable            characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion           Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables          into smaller tables and links them using relationships.       The purpose of Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate           redundant (repetitive) data and ensure data is stored         logically.

      The inventor of the relational model Edgar Codd               proposed the theory of normalization of data with the         introduction of the First Normal Form, and he continued       to extend theory with Second and Third Normal Form.           Later he joined Raymond F. Boyce to develop the theory        of Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

      Database Normal Forms:

      - 1NF (First Normal Form)
      - 2NF (Second Normal Form)
      - 3NF (Third Normal Form)
      - BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
      - 4NF (Fourth Normal Form)
      - 5NF (Fifth Normal Form)
      - 6NF (Sixth Normal Form)

     The Theory of Data Normalization in MySQL server is           still being developed further. For example, there are         discussions even on 6th Normal Form. However, in most         practical applications, normalization achieves its best       in 3rd Normal Form. The evolution of Normalization in         SQL theories is illustrated below.
