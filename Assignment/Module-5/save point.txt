       Answer ->

       * Savepoint in SQL :-

     . Savepoint is a command in SQL that is used with the           rollback command.

     . It is a command in Transaction Control Language that          is used to mark the transaction in a table.

     . Consider you are making a very long table, and you            want to roll back only to a certain position in a             table then; this can be achieved using the savepoint.

     . If you made a transaction in a table, you could mark          the transaction as a certain name, and later on, if           you want to roll back to that point, you can do it            easily by using the transaction's name.

     . Savepoint is helpful when we want to roll back only a         small part of a table and not the whole table. In             simple words, we can say savepoint is a bookmark in           SQL.

            Let us see the practical examples to understand        this concept more clearly. We will use the MySQL              database for writing all the queries.

            
     * create a save Point write a Query ? 


         A SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction in which         you can roll the transaction back to a certain point         without rolling back the entire transaction. 
 

         Syntax for Savepoint command: 
 

         SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME;


   * Syntax for rolling back to Savepoint command: 
 

         ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT_NAME;

       you can ROLLBACK to any SAVEPOINT at any time to              return the appropriate data to its original state. 


    EXAMPLE :-

        From the above example Sample table1, Delete those         records from the table which have age = 20 and then           ROLLBACK the changes in the database by keeping               Savepoints.

     Queries :

       SAVEPOINT SP1;
       //Savepoint created.
       DELETE FROM Student WHERE AGE = 20;
       //deleted
       SAVEPOINT SP2;
       //Savepoint created. 


       Here SP1 is first SAVEPOINT created before deletion.In        this example one deletion have taken place.
