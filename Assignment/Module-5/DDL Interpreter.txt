   Answer:-
  
     DDL Interpreter:

           It processes the DDL statements into a set of           table containing meta data (data about data). Embedded        DML Pre-compiler: It processes DML statements embedded        in an application program into procedural calls. Query        Optimizer: It executes the instruction generated by DML       Compiler.

     
     Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL. It         is a language for describing data and its relationships       in a database. You can generate DDL in a script for           database objects to: Keep a snapshot of the database          structure. Set up a test system where the database acts       like the production system but contains no data.

     DDL is defined as Data Definition Language : DDL is used      to define data structures which deals with database           descriptions.

    
      * Data Definition Language explained:

    
         DDL is a standardized language with commands to            define the storage groups (stogroups), different              structures and objects in a database. DDL statements          create, modify and remove database objects, such as           tables, indexes and stogroups. DDL is also used in a          generic sense to refer to any language that describes         data.

      DDL includes Structured Query Language (SQL) statements       to create and drop databases, aliases, locations,             indexes, tables and sequences.


      For example,:

      CREATE  : It helps to create database 
      ALTER   : it helps to alter the pre-existing data
      DROP    : It helps to delete objects or data from the                   database
      TRUNCATE: It remove all records from a table
      COMMENT : It helps to add comments to the data                          dictionary.
      RENAME  : It helps to rename an object in the database
